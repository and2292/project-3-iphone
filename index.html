	<p><em><b>BENEFITS</b></em></p>
	<p align="center">The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus received mixed reviews from critics.[11][12] Reviewers praised the speed of its processor, the updated camera, and the inclusion of non-proprietary wireless charging.[13] However, the iPhone 8 was criticized for its aging design and thick bezels dating back from 2014, while several competing smartphones had moved to nearly bezel-less designs to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor to the iPhone 8 Plus, including Apple's own iPhone X.[14][15][16]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed by reviewers showed that the rear glass on the 8 and 8 Plus is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[17][18].</p>
